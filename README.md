# Project A.L.I.E.N. Main Board

<!-- Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmail.com - 22/07/2024 -->

This is the repository for the main board of Project A.L.I.E.N. (Autonomous
Labyrinth Investigator, Explorer, Navigator).

This project started as a University project for the module
[Robotics Design and Construction](https://www.york.ac.uk/students/studying/manage/programmes/module-catalogue/module/ELE00098H).
To get us started, the University provided us with a main board, called the ARB
(Arduino Robotics Board), which was designed to break out the pins of an Arduino
Nano 33 BLE into connectors that were easier to use. However, when the module
concluded, the University wanted the boards back, so I designed my own.

## Testing

The code to test the board has been split into separate repositories.

- [Motors and Encoders](https://github.com/HBoyd255/project-alien-motor-test-code)
- [Bumper and NES Shift Registers](https://github.com/HBoyd255/project-alien-shift-register-test-code)
- [LED Strip and Level Shifter](https://github.com/HBoyd255/project-alien-led-strip-test-code)
- [Ultrasonic Sensor](https://github.com/HBoyd255/project-alien-ultrasonic-test-code)
- [Infrared Sensors and I2C Multiplexer](https://github.com/HBoyd255/project-alien-infrared-test-code)

## Expansion Boards

The Project A.L.I.E.N. Main Board has been designed to to take expansion boards.
This utilises the 3 left-over GPIO pins, D11, D12 and D13.
